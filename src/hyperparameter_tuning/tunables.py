    Query Autotune API for the experiment_name, direction, hpo_algo_impl, id_, objective_function, tunables and

    Parameters: search_space_json (json array): A JSON array containing the input search space to hyperparameter
    optimization module.

    Returns:
        experiment_name (str): The name of the application that is being optimized.
        direction (str): Direction of optimization, minimize or maximize.
        hpo_algo_impl (str): Hyperparameter optimization library to perform Bayesian Optimization.
        id_ (str): The experiment id of the application that is being optimized.
        objective_function (str): The objective function that is being optimized.
        tunables (list): A list containing the details of each tunable in a dictionary format.
        value_type (string): Value type of the objective function.
